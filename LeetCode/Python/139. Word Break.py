        """
        We will use two pointers start and end to consider any substring of the input string s. Pointer end will vary 
        from 1 to len(s) and we also have 0 â‰¤ start < end. Let us consider a substring of the input string s up to index end, i.e., s[:end]. 
        For this substring to be valid based on the requirements of the problem, there must be a left index start such that the 
        substring up to index start is valid and s[start:end] is also present in the dictionary. For example, suppose s = "isleetcode" and the 
        dictionary contains "is", "leet", and "code". When end = 10, we notice that for start = 6, the substring up to index start = 6, i.e., 
        "isleet" is valid and furthermore, substring s[6:10] is also present in the dictionary. Thus, the input string is a valid 
        string.
        The above example shows that the approach is better to start from end = 1 and increase end accordingly. If so, then we have 
        verified that "isleet" is valid before we want to evaluate the entire input string. Moreover, we can store the validity 
        results of a substring till index start in a 1D array of length 1 + len(s) where the first element corresponds to and empty 
        string and is set to True all the time. We call this array is_valid. 
        For instance, is_valid(1) indicates where the first element in the string can be decomposed using the dictionary word and 
        the last element in is_valid indicates whether the entire input string can be decomposed as such.
        
        Another Example:
        Input: s = "applepen", wordDict = ["app", "apple", "pen"]
        inner loop conditions: is_valid[start] and s[start:end] in wordDict
        end   = 1
        start = 0    is_valid[0] and s[0:1] in wordDict -> looks at: "",    "a":    no

        end   = 2
        start = 0    is_valid[0] and s[0:2] in wordDict -> looks at: "",    "ap":   no
              = 1    is_valid[1] and s[1:2] in wordDict -> looks at: "a",   "ap":   no

        end   = 3
        start = 0    is_valid[0] and s[0:3] in wordDict -> looks at: "" and "app":  yes
                      -> is_valid[3] = True (i.e., "app" can be segmented using the words in wordDict) 
                      -> break
        ...
        when end = 8, we are considering the whole input string and if is_valid[8] = True,
        it means that the input string can be segmented using the words in wordDict.
